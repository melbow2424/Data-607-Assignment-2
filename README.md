SQL and R connection

For the R file: 
I am using a database connection without providing my password. You will need to provide your local information from MySQL server to make the connection. It should work once connected to local server. 

For the SQL file: 
There are 2 tables: movie_rate and rater. The movie_rate table is the child table to the parent table rater. This can be seen in the sql code with created relationships. To handling missing data in the movie_rate, the data enter was not nulled and its default value was set to zero.
